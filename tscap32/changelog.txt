                               runtime package etc)

2003-03-31 -  Thomas stuefe -  initial release of 3.1open

History:
tscap32 was developed originally 1996 and used in a range of medical 
applications, later for a long time sold as shareware. 

Development pretty much ceased after 2000, as I didn't have time to 
maintain the component. People urged me to release the source code, 
so after a time I decided to release the component's source under GPL.
